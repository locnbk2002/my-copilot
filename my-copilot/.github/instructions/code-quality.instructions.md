# Code Quality

- After making multiple edits, consider if code can be **simplified**
- Keep files under **200 lines** — split into modules when exceeded
- Extract common patterns into shared utilities
- **Modify originals directly** — don't create "enhanced" copies
- Write clean, readable code — optimize for maintainability
- Handle errors explicitly; don't swallow exceptions silently
